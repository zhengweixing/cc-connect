# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- **`agent_session_idle_timeout_mins`**: new per-project config option that closes an idle live agent process after a clean turn while preserving the cc-connect session and saved agent session ID. The next message starts a new agent process and resumes the same conversation. Set to `0` or leave unset to disable (#1338).
- **Reasonix agent**: new agent adapter for Reasonix multi-model coding agent, bridging via HTTP serve API (POST /submit, SSE /events, POST /approve). Supports default/yolo/plan permission modes, SSE auto-reconnect with backoff, and thinking accumulator. (#1281)
- **cloud_web platform**: 新增 self-hosted IM Gateway 作为 first-class platform 接入 (CWIP v1 协议,支持 websocket / long_poll / gateway 3 种 transport,完整 inbound/outbound + capability negotiation + graceful degradation)。 详见 docs/cloud-web.md + #1282。

## Unreleased

### Added
- **Feishu: outbound bot-to-bot @mention resolution** via new `mention_map` config option. Maps agent-friendly names (e.g. `BOT-A`) to Feishu open_ids so that when an agent writes `@BOT-A` in its reply, cc-connect converts it to a native Feishu `<at>` tag that triggers a real notification. Layered on top of `resolve_mentions` (group-member matching) with higher priority, so explicit config always wins (#1322).

### Fixed
- **Feishu recall fallback probes**: throttle repeated active-message recall checks so long-running turns do not continuously call platform message APIs.
- **Skill discovery depth-1 only**: skill scanning no longer recurses into subdirectories. Only `<skill_dir>/<name>/SKILL.md` is registered; nested SKILL.md files (e.g. inside `<name>/references/...`) are treated as skill assets and ignored, matching the Claude Code CLI convention. Previously, nested SKILL.md files leaked into platform command menus as phantom slash commands (101 leaked commands from `frontend-design` skill alone) (#1304).
- **Feishu: tighter `@` mention detection in `SendWithStatusFooter` / `buildReplyContent`** — a bare `@` inside an email address, URL, or escaped character no longer false-positives as a mention. Mention detection now checks for the resolved `<at user_id="...">` tag instead of a substring match, so card rendering (and the notation-style status footer) is preserved for content that merely contains `@`. Real `@mentions` still force `MsgTypeText` so Feishu fires the mention event (#1322).
- **feishu**: coalesce consecutive image messages from the same session into a single multi-image dispatch to fix first-image drop on batch sends (#1395). When the Feishu mobile client sends N images in quick succession, each image arrives as a separate `image` event with very close `create_time` values. Dispatching each immediately caused core/engine's `create_time` watermark (PR #1168) to drop the oldest image, so the agent only saw N-1 images. A per-session image buffer with a 150ms quiet window now merges the burst into one `core.Message` carrying all images, in send order. Single-image sends and quoted-image replies are unaffected.
- **claudecode**: fix per-spawn system-prompt temp file EACCES under `run_as_user` (#1429). The per-spawn temp file written by `writeTempAppendPromptFile` (the 1% edge-case path used when the prompt has session-specific platform formatting or user `append_system_prompt`) inherited `os.CreateTemp`'s 0600 mode and was owned by the cc-connect process user (often root under systemd). When the agent was spawned under a different `run_as_user`, it could not read the file and exited before any prompt was loaded. The file is now `chmod 0o644` immediately after write, matching the shared `ensureSharedSystemPromptFile` path. Prompt content is non-secret (a superset of the already-shared base prompt), so 0644 is consistent with the shared file. Does not affect the shared-file path (already 0644 since #1376) or the daemon-mode path resolution (#1419).
- **core**: queue post-restart notification and dispatch on platform ready (#1383). Previously `/restart` sent the success notification immediately after engine startup, racing the platform's async connect window (Telegram: ~2.6s). On a not-yet-ready platform the send was silently dropped at debug log level. The notify is now queued on the engine and dispatched when the target platform reaches `OnPlatformReady`, with bounded retry (3 attempts, 0/500/1500 ms backoff) on transient send failure. Failed sends log at warn level. A 10s safety timeout drops the notify with a warning if the target platform never reaches ready, so startup is never blocked indefinitely. Also covers Discord / Weixin / Matrix (other AsyncRecoverablePlatform implementations) for free.
- **core**: `SaveFilesToDisk` / `AppendFileRefs` always emit absolute paths (#1459). When a user configured a relative `work_dir` (e.g. `~/project` or `.cc-connect`), `SaveFilesToDisk` joined relative paths into the attachments directory and the resulting paths were passed verbatim into the agent's prompt. The spawned agent process — typically run from a different cwd by the platform adapter — could not resolve them and silently dropped every attachment. `SaveFilesToDisk` now calls `filepath.Abs(workDir)` up front and falls back to the raw value on error, and `AppendFileRefs` defensively absolutizes each entry. Both behaviors are covered by new tests for relative, absolute, and empty workDir; the empty-workDir case falls back to the process cwd so misconfigured deploys still get a writable attachments directory.

## v1.3.3 (2026-06-15)

First stable release of the 1.3.3 series. Stabilizes the v1.3.3-beta.1 → v1.3.3-beta.5
line (≈ 235 PRs since v1.3.2) plus 7 post-beta.5 fixes. See `changelogs/v1.3.3.md` for
the full themed summary; per-beta details remain in the beta sections below.

### Highlights
- **New agents**: Devin CLI, Google Antigravity (`agy`), GitHub Copilot — all first
  class. Hardened coverage for Cursor, OpenCode, Qoder, Kimi, Pi.
- **Platform expansion**: QQ Bot inline keyboards + file send/receive (OneBot), WeCom
  `SendFile` (WebSocket), Feishu audio + video native media, Slack Assistant API, MAX
  webhook delivery, DingTalk @mentions / richText / image / file inbound, WPS Xiezuo
  (金山协作), broader Weibo DM.
- **Long-running turn hardening**: new `max_turn_time_mins` wall-clock cap with
  soft-stop + force-kill + auto-resume — long bash / test commands can no longer lock
  a session indefinitely.
- **Core commands**: `/timer`, `/cancel`, `/ps` (replaces `/btw`), `cron add --silent`,
  agent-driven TTS.
- **Multi-user / permissions**: reply-to-unauthorized-IM-senders, @mention-tolerant
  permission keywords (`@Bot/permit` ≡ `/permit`), Bridge requires token when enabled.
- **Observability**: blackbox testing framework (P0/P1/P2 + config-switch matrix), CUJ
  test framework, agent-resume regression suite, Pi context-usage reporter.
- **Provider ecosystem**: NekoCode, VisionCoder, AIHubMix, MiniMax M3 presets; Claude
  Code 1M-context Opus + `append_system_prompt` + PermissionRequest hooks; Codex
  `request_user_input` app-server events; configurable shell + shell profile.

### Post-beta.5 fixes (delta from beta.5)
- **qoder**: emit streaming text without dropping final result (#1290)
- **weixin**: use `ilink_user_id` in `getConfigReq` for typing ticket (#1308)
- **daemon**: remove redundant `linger_other.go` that breaks non-linux builds (#1314)
- **wps-xiezuo**: preserve newlines in outbound messages — fixes unreadable `/status`
  (#1361)
- **core**: `/switch` no longer loses history; persist user msgs immediately; add CUJ
  test framework (#1348)
- **core**: queued FIFO drains no longer drop earlier queued messages as stale just
  because a later queued message has a higher `create_time` (#1286)
- **core**: make `/history` entry truncation configurable via
  `[display].history_max_len`, defaulting to 1000; `0` disables truncation (#1291)
- **tts/minimax**: drop `status=2` trailer chunk to stop audio playing twice (#1364)
- **tests**: add provider-resume regression tests for codex / opencode / kimi (#1366)

### ⚠️ Behavior Changes (carried forward from the beta cycle)
All behavior changes from beta.1 → beta.5 remain in effect for v1.3.3. **Most likely
to affect existing configs:**
- `progress_style` default for Telegram & Discord is now `compact` (was `legacy`). Set
  `progress_style = "legacy"` to revert. (#1354)
- QQ Bot default `intents` now include `INTERACTION_CREATE` (bit 26). Custom `intents`
  must include `1<<26` for inline keyboard buttons.
- DingTalk `msgtype=file` inbound now reaches the agent (#1357).
- Engine permission keyword matching is @mention-tolerant: `@Bot/permit` ≡ `/permit`
  (#1358).
- `reset_on_idle_mins` default is now 30 minutes (#494). Set to `0` to disable.
- Bridge with no `[bridge].token` configured will refuse to start (#408).

### Breaking Changes
**None.** Fully additive release.

### Upgrade
```bash
npm i -g cc-connect@1.3.3
# or
go install github.com/chenhg5/cc-connect/cmd/cc-connect@v1.3.3
```

Coming from a `v1.3.3-beta.*`: this is a small fix-only upgrade. No config change
required.

Coming from `v1.3.2`: review the Behavior Changes above before upgrading.

## v1.3.3-beta.5 (2026-06-15)

Large beta with 74 PRs from 28 contributors. New agents (Google Antigravity `agy`, GitHub Copilot), QQ
file send/receive via OneBot, WeCom `SendFile` (WebSocket), Feishu audio/video media, agent-driven TTS,
`/timer` and `/cancel` commands, and broad platform fixes across Telegram, Discord, DingTalk, Feishu,
WeCom, WeiXin, Cursor, OpenCode, Pi, and Codex. See `changelogs/v1.3.3-beta.5.md` for the full list.

### New Features
- **Google Antigravity (`agy`)** agent as a first-class integration (#1123)
- **GitHub Copilot** agent as a first-class integration (#865)
- **`/timer`** — one-shot delayed task system (#1012)
- **`/cancel`** — interrupt and reset the current session (#957)
- **Session prune** command to remove duplicate sessions (#603)
- **Agent-driven TTS** send (#1230)
- **Reply to unauthorized IM senders** option (#1190)
- **QQ Bot inline keyboard buttons** and INTERACTION_CREATE events. Permission requests now render as clickable buttons (#1131)
- **QQ (OneBot) file send/receive** via HTTP API (#323)
- **WeCom `SendFile`** in WebSocket mode (#1199)
- **Feishu audio + video attachments** as native media (#1202)
- **Feishu rich card rendering + panel handling** refresh (#1204)
- **DingTalk reaction emoji** support (#1213)
- **DingTalk @mention via `send --at-users` / `--at-all`** (#1188)
- **Slack + tmux** per-thread session scope with per-session tmux windows (#1179)
- **`cron add --silent`** CLI flag (#1285, closes #858)
- **Codex `request_user_input`** app-server events + relay group visibility (#1200, #1209)
- **Claude Code** custom `append_system_prompt` + PermissionRequest hooks (#1175, #850)
- **Pi** `ContextUsageReporter` for reply footer token stats (#1235)
- **Daemon** hardened service-file env capture + EnvDiscoverer plugin hook (#1034)
- **Configurable shell + shell profile** for `exec` (#870)

### Fixed
- Many fixes across the engine, agents, and platforms. Highlights: Telegram/Discord progress style,
  DingTalk file inbound, Feishu link/card URLs, WeCom long-message split, Cursor session titles,
  OpenCode tool rejection, Codex resume + sandbox_mode, Pi `/dir` and `/model`, Windows instance
  lock, and Claude Code provider preservation. See `changelogs/v1.3.3-beta.5.md`.

### ⚠️ Behavior Notes
- **`progress_style` default** for Telegram and Discord is now `compact` (was `legacy`). Set
  `progress_style = "legacy"` in the platform config to restore previous behavior (#1354).
- **DingTalk `msgtype=file`** inbound messages now reach the agent. Previously silently dropped (#1357).
- **Engine permission keyword matching** is now @mention-tolerant: `@Bot/permit` matches the same as
  `/permit` (#1358).

### ⚠️ QQ Bot Intent Configuration
The default intents for QQ Bot now include `INTERACTION_CREATE` (bit 26, value `1<<26`). If you
previously set a custom `intents` value without this bit, inline keyboard buttons will not work —
update your `intents` to include bit 26. If you use the default intents, no action is needed. See
`config.example.toml` for the new `intents` option.

## v1.3.3-beta.4 (2026-05-28)

### New Features
- **`max_turn_time_mins`**: new config option — absolute wall-clock cap per agent turn that does NOT reset on tool-call events. Prevents long-running bash commands from permanently locking the session (#1091). Uses a two-phase shutdown: soft stop (10s grace) then force-kill. Session is preserved and resumed via `--resume` on the next message.

### Fixed
- **Web console 404 regression**: `make release-all` did not depend on `make web`, so release binaries were built without frontend assets when `web/dist/` was empty (gitignored). All routes on the management port returned `404`. Fixed by adding `web` as a prerequisite of `release-all` (#1136)
- **Slack @mention without space**: `stripAppMentionText` only matched `"> "` (with trailing space), so `@Bot/command` (no space) was forwarded verbatim to Claude instead of being parsed as a command
- **DingTalk `msgtype="picture"` dropped**: image messages delivered as `"picture"` (instead of `"image"`) were silently dropped. Both types now route to the image handler (#1128)
- **Feishu `require_mention = false` ignored**: the platform read `group_reply_all` but users set `require_mention = false`; now both are treated as equivalent (#1141)
- **AskUserQuestion resolved with empty answer**: delivery receipts and read-notifications (empty messages) were accepted as valid answers to `AskUserQuestion`, resolving it within ~500ms before the user could respond. Empty/whitespace content is now rejected (#1086)

## v1.3.3-beta.3 (2026-05-24)

Beta release with blackbox testing infrastructure, cursor/opencode agent support, and bug fixes.

### New Features
- **Blackbox testing framework**: Phase 1-2 blackbox testing with P0/P1/P2 coverage, config-switch, and NewEnvWithSetup infrastructure
- **Cursor/OpenCode agents**: add cursor and opencode agent support in blackbox tests

### Fixed
- **Core italic wrapping**: restore italic wrapping on reply footer
- **Feishu footer asterisks**: strip asterisks from footer to prevent Feishu markdown italic rendering
- **Kimi session UUID**: capture session UUID from stderr instead of stdout
- **Codex stdio sentinel**: add stdio sentinel for Codex app_server backend
- **Windows cross-compile**: add missing `CheckLinger` stub to `daemon/windows.go` and `daemon/unsupported.go` so `make release-all` succeeds for all target platforms

## v1.3.3-beta.2 (2026-05-09)

Beta release with Slack Assistant API, DingTalk improvements, MAX platform webhook mode, and numerous platform fixes. No breaking changes.

### New Features
- **Slack Assistant API**: support Slack Assistant API (Agent toggle) with natural on/off switching (#844)

- **display_mode enum**: add `display_mode` enum to replace boolean `quiet` config, with quiet/compact/normal/full options (#655)
- **Core reset_on_idle_mins default**: default to 30 minutes to prevent context drift (#494)
- **Claude Code custom system prompt**: add support for custom system prompt configuration via `system_prompt` option (#534)

### Fixed
- **Bridge security**: require token when Bridge is enabled to prevent unauthorized access (#408)
- **Feishu recalled messages**: handle recalled messages gracefully (#841)
- **Feishu media download failure**: notify user when media download fails instead of silent drop (#815)
- **WeChat video messages**: send video files as proper video messages in WeChat (#813)
- **WeChat incomplete delivery**: notify user on incomplete message delivery and enhance retry logging (#771)
- **Telegram private topics**: preserve private topic session keys (#804)
- **Kimi session UUID**: capture session UUID from stderr instead of stdout (#766)
- **Codex app_server config**: app_server backend should honor model/effort/provider config + add stdio sentinel (#837)
- **Codex progress rendering**: render progress in rich Card 2.0 format (#838)
- **Core ellipsis events**: suppress ellipsis-only events and handle context indicator in footer
- **Core Markdown table**: render inline formatting inside GFM table cells (#675)
- **Feishu user id resolution**: guard user id resolution against edge cases
- **Feishu thread topics**: skip quote injection in thread-isolated topics (#767)
- **Config display mode**: honor project display mode setting
- **Daemon restart**: add --force flag to daemon restart command (#736)
- **AskUserQuestion**: use question text as answers key for proper answer routing (#822)

## v1.3.3-beta.1 (2026-04-25)

Beta release with new agents, new features, and broad platform fixes. No breaking changes.

### New Features
- **Devin agent**: add Devin CLI as a first-class agent with full `/list`, `/mode`, and session management (#672)
- **`/ps` command** (replaces `/btw`): send a message to a busy session mid-turn; `/btw` kept as alias for backward compatibility (#620)
- **`!` shell shortcut**: use `!ls -la` as shorthand for `/shell ls -la`, with optional `--timeout` parameter (#658)
- **NO_REPLY suppression**: agents can return `NO_REPLY` to silently skip platform delivery, useful for cron/analysis tasks (#682)
- **Feishu shared WebSocket**: multiple projects sharing the same `app_id` now share one WebSocket connection with per-project `allow_chat` / `group_only` filtering (#613)
- **Message queue depth configurable**: new `[queue] max_depth` config option (default 5) (#690)
- **Claude Code opus[1m]**: add 1M-context Opus model option with shorthand descriptions (#660)
- **QQ Bot file send/receive**: full file attachment support with robustness checks (#685)
- **Bridge ImageSender/FileSender**: `cc-connect send --image/--file` now works through bridge protocol (#712)
- **Provider presets**: add NekoCode, VisionCoder, and AIHubMix to provider presets; add Trae CLI ACP and COCO ACP config examples (#739)

### Fixed
- **OpenCode image handling**: inbound images from WeChat/WeCom are now correctly passed to OpenCode CLI via `--file` flags (#717)
- **Slack Markdown**: convert standard Markdown to Slack mrkdwn format (bold, italic, strike, links, headings) (#680)
- **QQ Bot reconnect**: cancel stale goroutines on WebSocket reconnect to prevent race conditions (#678)
- **Gemini multiline prompt**: pass prompt via stdin to preserve newlines (#695)

## v1.3.2 (2026-04-21)

Hotfix release: session filtering is now configurable and defaults to showing all sessions.

### Fixed
- **`/list` shows all sessions by default**: the session filter introduced in v1.3.0 (which hid sessions not created by cc-connect) was accidentally merged and caused confusion. The filter is now **off by default** — `/list`, `/switch`, and `/delete` show all agent sessions regardless of origin.

### Added
- **`filter_external_sessions` config option**: users who *do* want to hide externally-created sessions can set `filter_external_sessions = true` in `[[projects]]` to restore the old filtering behavior.
- **Comprehensive integration tests**: real-agent E2E tests for both Codex and Claude Code covering the full `/list` → `/new` → conversation → `/list` lifecycle with provider-based authentication (no env-var API keys required). Plus 9 adapter-level filter tests using real Codex/Claude Code session file fixtures.

## v1.3.1 (2026-04-20)

Patch release with critical bug fixes for session management, config preservation, and Weibo media support.

### Fixed
- **Session visibility (`/list`)**: historical Codex sessions disappeared after upgrade due to `AgentSessionID` being cleared on `/new` or provider switch without preservation. Added `PastAgentSessionIDs` tracking with legacy data migration so existing sessions remain visible.
- **Session naming (`/new xxx`)**: custom session names from `/new` were not mapped to the agent session ID for agents where the ID is established asynchronously (Codex, Qoder, Kimi, etc.). Added name mapping to all `EventResult` and `EventText` handlers across interactive, relay, and drain paths.
- **Config comment preservation**: `/provider switch`, `/model`, `/lang`, display settings, and TTS changes now use surgical text-level editing instead of full TOML re-serialization, preserving all comments, unknown fields, and formatting.
- **Codex `codex_home` path**: session listing, history, and deletion now consistently use the configured `codex_home` instead of hardcoded `~/.codex`.
- **Feishu card callback hint**: log a reminder when interactive card mode is enabled but `card.action.trigger` may not be subscribed.

### Added
- **Weibo image & file support**: send and receive images and files in Weibo DMs via base64 encoding within the WebSocket `send_message` payload. Implements `ImageSender` and `FileSender` interfaces.
- **Comprehensive session tests**: 12 new `SessionManager` unit tests covering `PastAgentSessionIDs`, legacy data migration, and version-based schema detection. 9 new `Engine` integration tests covering `/list` visibility across `/new`, provider switch, and real-world legacy data scenarios, plus end-to-end session name mapping tests for all three agent ID patterns (immediate, EventText, EventResult).
- **Config preservation tests**: 8 new tests verifying comment and field preservation for `SaveActiveProvider`, `SaveAgentModel`, `SaveProviderModel`, `SaveLanguage`, `SaveDisplayConfig`, `SaveTTSMode`, multi-project config, and global provider refs.

## v1.3.0 (2026-04-19)

First stable release of the 1.3 series. 555 commits since v1.2.1 with major new features, platform improvements, and broad community contributions.

### Highlights

- **Web Admin UI** — Full management dashboard embedded in the binary via `go:embed`. Project CRUD, session monitoring, cron editor, provider management, chat interface, and i18n (en/zh/zh-TW/ja/es). Use `cc-connect web` to open directly in the browser with auto-login.
- **Lifecycle Event Hooks** — New `[[hooks]]` config to trigger shell commands or HTTP webhooks on 7 event types: `message.received`, `message.sent`, `session.started`, `session.ended`, `cron.triggered`, `permission.requested`, `error`. Async by default, fail-open, non-blocking.
- **Skill Management** — New `/skills` page in the web UI with local skill browser (per-project, per-agent) and recommended skill presets fetched from remote.
- **Global Provider Management** — Add, edit, delete providers in the web UI; import from cc-switch config; per-agent-type provider presets with featured/star badges.

## v1.2.2-beta.5 (2026-03-31)

Beta release with embedded web admin, Discord proxy support, multimodal fixes, and major platform improvements.

### New Features
- **Embedded Web Admin**: Web frontend is now compiled into the binary via `go:embed` — no separate `npm install` needed. Use `/web setup` to configure, or build with `no_web` tag to exclude. Binary size increases ~1MB (#356)
- **Web Admin Dashboard**: Full-featured management UI with project CRUD, session management, cron job editor, global settings, chat interface with bridge WebSocket, slash commands, and i18n (en/zh/zh-TW/ja/es) (#316)
- **Discord Proxy Support**: Discord platform now supports `proxy`, `proxy_username`, `proxy_password` options for HTTP API and WebSocket Gateway connections
- **Feishu Progress Styles**: Configurable progress display styles (compact/card) to reduce message spam
- **Claude Code Auto-Permission Mode**: New `auto` permission mode for Claude Code agent (#329)
- **WeCom File Receiving**: WeCom HTTP callback now supports receiving files and forwarding them to the agent (#330)

- **`/restart` Command**: Restart cc-connect service from chat with post-restart success notification
- **`/config reload` Command**: Hot-reload configuration (display, providers, commands) without restarting
- **`/name` Command**: Set custom display names for sessions (e.g. `/name my-feature`, `/name 3 bugfix`); names persist across restarts and show in `/list`, `/switch`, `/status`
- **Default Quiet Mode**: Configure `quiet = true` globally or per-project in config.toml to suppress thinking/tool progress by default; users can still toggle with `/quiet`
- **Command Prefix Matching**: Type shortened commands like `/pro l` for `/provider list`, `/sw 2` for `/switch 2`; works for all commands and subcommands
- **Numeric Session Switching**: `/list` shows numbered sessions; `/switch 3` switches by number instead of copying long IDs
- **Group Chat Mention Filtering**: Feishu, Discord, and Telegram bots now only respond to @mentions in group chats instead of all messages
- **Claude Code Router Support**: Integration with Claude Code Router for enhanced routing capabilities
- **Third-party Provider Proxy**: Local reverse proxy rewrites incompatible `thinking` parameters for third-party LLM providers (e.g. SiliconFlow)

- **API Server Shutdown**: Clean shutdown without "use of closed network connection" error
- **Agent Session Timeouts**: 8-second graceful shutdown timeout for all agent sessions with kill fallback
- **Feishu Rich Text**: Use Post (rich text) messages instead of Interactive Cards for normal font size

### Bug Fixes
- **DingTalk Startup**: Fix false startup failure when stream client returns nil error
- **Deadlock on /new and /switch**: Release lock before async agent session close to prevent hangs
- **Provider Command**: Correctly list providers when no active provider is set
- **Unknown Command Handling**: Show i18n-friendly warning and fall through to agent for native commands

### Security & Reliability
- **Race Condition Fixes**: `sync.Once` for channel close, mutex protection for concurrent fields, non-blocking event sends
- **Atomic File Writes**: Config, session, and cron files use temp+rename pattern
- **Message Deduplication**: Platform-level dedup for Feishu and DingTalk webhooks
- **HTTP Client Timeouts**: Shared 30s-timeout HTTP client for all outbound requests
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Validate command file paths
